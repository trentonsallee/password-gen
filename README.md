## Usage
 The user selects which password elements is wanted which are returned as a bolean. The selected elements are combined in a string using if statements. The user then enters the length with parameters. If the parameters are exceeded, alert errors displayed. Then the password is generated in a for loop getting random elements from the sting of selected elements for the length of user input.
